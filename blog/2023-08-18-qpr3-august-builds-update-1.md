Hello Everyone, the **QPR3** update was due for a while and it's finally here.

<!--truncate-->

The last **QPR3** update is here and with it comes the latest **August Security Patch** along with many new features and bug fixes. The new update will be dropped soon for every device on our ***Official Device Roster*** in the upcoming days.Â 

P.S: This update will not be pushed through OTA as it's a complete rebase of the source and we suggest every user to do a **Clean Flash** if you face any problems after doing a dirty flash over the last **QPR2** Build.



Lets just jump into the *[Source Changelog Here!](https://github.com/protonplus-org/ota/blob/tm-qpr3/source_changelog/source_changelog.txt)*
