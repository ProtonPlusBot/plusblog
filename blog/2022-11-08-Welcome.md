Konnichiwa Everyone! We are glad to announce that our blog is live. With this all we want to share is exciting News in our upcoming update which is going to come soon. 

<!--truncate-->

We are still working hard since the last update. We had to postpone Mid October Release because we couldnt ready our source as we were facing some issues. But with the latest security patch being released expect a pretty big update from our side.

We will be announcing the changes soon. For now this concludes our first ever post on our blog.
