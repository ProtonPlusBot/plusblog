Konnichiwa Minasan!

As you guys know after the November Update there were few critical bugs like broken Lockscreen clock on many devices along with Google Orginal Quality Photo Backup was broken. We have pushed the changes for those bugs soon after and even pushed Hotfix builds for concerned devices.

Meanwhile we also added Redmi Note 10 Pro/ Pro Max aka "sweet" on our Build Rosterï»¿. While we wish that things would stay same but we have almost at the end of November and December Security Patch is just in the corner while we were trying to figure out life :p hopefully we will be able to merge the Security Patch as soon as it drops.

While we ready ourselves for the December update we will like to remind you as of now we depend on Donations to maintain our infra and Build Server so feel free to donate as much as you can. Til then Have a Great Day.
