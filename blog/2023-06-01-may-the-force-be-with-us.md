![ProtonPlus QPR2 Update](/img/frame-105-1-.png)

Hello There, It’s been a while since we last updated this blog and we know as usual we are late. But Hey at least we are still alive and kicking.

<!--truncate-->

As you guys can tell we were not much active in our support groups and as well as in our git, the reason being most of us are still students and there are times we need to spend time focusing on our studies duh! As the life happened and we slowly started working we faced a sudden urgency of server availability and the luck wasn’t on our side which delayed this update furthermore but finally we are here and the latest iteration of ***ProtonPlus*** is here based on ***QPR2***.

Let’s start with the most important features we have added on this update. Starting with App Lock to safekeep your Apps from guests lurking around your gallery or private apps. Next up we have added Network Speed Meter for the nerds out there who like to glue their eyes on the network speed. We have also added custom fonts, shapes and icon support in this new update. Talking about the whole changelog will take a long time so here’s the ***[Complete Source Changelog Highlight](https://github.com/protonplus-org/ota/tree/tm/source_changelog)***.

With this update we are also adding a few new devices on our build roster of Official Devices, hopefully new devices will bring in more excitement and experiences in our team as well as in our lovely community.

We hope this update brings you joy and maybe just little bit put a smile on your face just because finally some of your important feature being added and now you can die in peace \*Just Kidding\*.

Also a huge thanks to ***[RokuSenpai](https://github.com/rokusenpaii)*** for helping us through and through from the beginning of this project we can’t thank him enough, without him this project would have never seen the light.
