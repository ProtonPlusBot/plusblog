Konnichiwa Minasan!

I hope your New Year is going well; if not, here is a news that might put a smile on your face. Yes, the ***protonplus*** **January update** is ready, and we are going to roll out the update for supported devices in the upcoming days. Existing users will get an OTA update, and new users will get the full Build Link in the device-related posts.

So what's new in the January Update? The security patch has been bumped and is up-to-date with the latest ASB. We have reached the feature threshold on ***protonplus***, as mentioned in our last public release in November, and we may add a few things in future releases, but for now it is complete. We hope everyone enjoys the update, and our developer friends have been asked to build ***protonplus*** for their devices. Feel free to submit any patches; we will be glad to see you building ***protonplus*** for your device.

If you liked our project and want to contribute, then we will be very happy if you can **[donate](https://t.me/YetAnotherAkatsuki/7)** because we depend on donations to keep our infrastructure up, including the build server.
