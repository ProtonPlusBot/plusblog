Hello GenesisOS Community!

It has been a great year so far. Born out of the ashes of ProtonPlus, GenesisOS was something new and hopeful for us and with a great team now behind this project we’re back with an exciting update based on the next version of Android operating system Android 15. Here’s what’s happening:

<!-- truncate -->

### Introducing Android 15 – Verve

Verve, standing for vigor and spirit or enthusiasm, is our latest Android 15-based update, which has been in development as you guys all know, is ready to sail off with great vigor. After going through the last major update of v3.0 based on Android 14 QPR3 we sat down on the table and looked back on all the feedback we got from our community and we knew it's time to go back to the drawing board.

Thanks to all of your feedback we remembered why our community loves our project. It's the simplicity, the clean, no nonsense experience that we love. Focusing on our core principles we worked hard to make the Initial Android 15 Build full of vigor and enthusiasm. 

The source code of GenesisOS 4.0 Verve is up on Github and is ready to build. We will bring in the features from v3.0 one by one with the upcoming updates so stay tuned until we make sure the features are stable enough to be shipped in our future updates.

### Our Versioning System

We think there has been some confusion related to our versioning among our community members so we thought of explaining it and fixing things up for all. For GenesisOS, since this one, major increments (e.g., 4.0, 5.0) will be used for main android releases, while subversions (e.g., 4.1, 4.2) will mark full rebases, such as when we merge QPR updates. Ex. GenesisOS 4.1 Verve will mark GenesisOS Android 15 QPR1. Verve is the codename of our version of Android 15, similar to how Google calls it Android V or VanillaIceCream.

### Continued Support for Android 14

No commitment here tho, we will try and if time falls in our hand, GenesisOS 3.0 Utopia (Android 14) based versions will receive ongoing updates for stability and security patches.

### Roster Update & Release Timeline

We encourage everyone who wants to maintain GenesisOS officially to apply for maintainership as it helps us all grow. We're already looking for a maintainer for violet, munch and peridot. It's always good to welcome new members to our family and the more devices we have on our roster the better.

We will start releasing updates of GenesisOS 4.0 Verve from soon date of the soon month of the soon year. Jokes aside, expect builds dropping from the starting of this week.

This year ends with a New Beginning. If you like our project then please consider donating for our Project Infra, this helps us to run the Project longer than ever. If you have any suggestions then please feel free to drop feedback using our feedback form. Last but not the least thank you for your patience and we hope you enjoy your experience with GenesisOS.
